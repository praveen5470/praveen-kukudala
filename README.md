# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Certainly! Here's a concise and descriptive README section you can use for your GitHub project:

## Portfolio of Praveen Kukudala

Welcome to the portfolio of Praveen Kukudala! This project showcases a minimal React application using Vite as the build tool. It provides a quick and efficient setup for developing modern web applications with React.

### Features

- **React Integration**: Utilizes React for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Vite Build Tool**: Leverages Vite for fast development and build processes, offering a smooth development experience with features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- **Fast Refresh**: Supports real-time updates with Fast Refresh, enhancing the development workflow.

### Official Vite Plugins Used

- **`@vitejs/plugin-react`**: Integrates React with Vite using Babel for Fast Refresh. Ideal for quick iterations and maintaining React component states during development.
- **`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`**: An alternative to Babel, this plugin uses SWC for Fast Refresh, offering improved performance.
